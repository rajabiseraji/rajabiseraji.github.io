As I worked with react for quite some time, I was able to gather some source materials in order to teach a course about fundamentals of react. In this course I mainly focused on basic characteristics of the framework and introduced concepts such as Web Components, component relationships, event handling and syntax of react and also pointed to some basic Redux matters, as well. In every other session, the students were tasked to complete a code snippet like the one they saw in the previous session and could participate in the learning process by doing this activity. In the end all of them were tasked to create a simple shopping app using the things they'd just learnt. The evaluation for this course is yet to be ready.",

I don't really think that I've been living up to my full academic potential in the past years and that's the reason I've been trying to change my route, take more online courses, participate in some active research in Computer Graphics, Game Development and HCI. I see myself in a professor's robe in a couple of years and I don't think anything or anyone can stop me from getting there :) so, now that you know almost everything about me, let me tell you more about my hobbies."

I don't think that games are for kids, or that they're a simple waste of time, games are just novel ways of telling a story, experiencing the lives you couldn't live and trying the things you can't be even thinking of doing in the real life; in a sentence, games are awesome! (of course I don't mean mind-numbing casual mobile games that make you itch and spend every moment of your life :D). Math on the other hand, don't you really think it's amazing that we can model the world around us using a series of rules, measure it and then solve it using them? if you don't, then sorry my friend because you're quite dead inside :D nothing could ever bring me the satisfaction of solving a calculus or geometry problem after two weeks of thinking and struggling."
