As I worked with react for quite some time, I was able to gather some source materials in order to teach a course about fundamentals of react. In this course I mainly focused on basic characteristics of the framework and introduced concepts such as Web Components, component relationships, event handling and syntax of react and also pointed to some basic Redux matters, as well. In every other session, the students were tasked to complete a code snippet like the one they saw in the previous session and could participate in the learning process by doing this activiy. In the end all of them were tasked to create a simple shopping app using the things they'd just learnt. The evaluation for this course is yet to be ready.",

The first session was an introduction into the basics of Vue and reactive thinking, along with a sample Todo app in vue. We were exploring componentization of a web page and website in second and third sessions. Finally the students were introduced to Stores in vue, which is implemented in Vuex and became aquainted with the concepts of Actions, Mutations and States.

Using the benchmark data I've come up with a new way that combines accoustic mapping and Wi-Fi fingerprinting to acquire a 2D map of an indoor environment and actively track the connected users in it. This is a hot topic in networking and has quite a large demand in the market.",
