In every other session, the students were tasked to complete a code snippet like the one they saw in the previous session and could participate in the learning process by doing this activity. In the end all of them were tasked to create a simple shopping app using the things they'd just learnt. The evaluation for this course is yet to be ready.",

The program was mainly targeted freshmen and other new students of computer engineering/science and was offered in five session (25 hours in total). In this course, I concentrated on the basic aspects of web development and its basic technologies, namely HTML 5, CSS and basic JavaScript. This course assumes that the learner has close to no prior experience in web design and focuses on introducing the students to the world of web development. I dedicated the first two sessions of the course to a basic introduction and history of web, as well as baby steps towards programming in that world. The other sessions were dedicated to workshops in which the students coded in real-time and compared the results to each other. more information is available in the links below.",

As a high school student I just loved Geometry, Differential Equations and Calculus! I'm sure you can ask from any of my teachers and they'll vouch for me quite passionately (oh I used to drive them crazy with my questions :D I couldn't help it much). My main goal and interest during this era was becoming a scientist, someone who can contribute to the existing mathematical knowledge and be outstanding, while doing it."

Here I became fascinated with student activities that are there for the students and are also run by them, I became more and more drawn to the Student Scientific Chapter of our faculty by our seniors and eventually was elected as a member of it, for two consecutive terms. I found working as a member of our scientific chapter really amazing, it's comprised of a variety of tasks that I could never even dream of doing as a student, tasks like holding international contests, fairs and talks, communicating with the wide variety of industrial and academic people."

Through this experience I came to know the responsibilities of a good teacher and I could also use my ideas as a student to further improve my teaching methods and skills. Being a teaching assistant, also helped me to establish useful relationships with many members of our faculty and professors. I also participated in two main research projects, one of which is my final thesis; so I can tell I have quite a lot of educational experience to start with, it turns me into a quite good graduate candidate, something I'm trying to do my best to be better at."

I started in the summer after my third semester, working as an intern, learning iOS programming, Android programming and also PHP. Since I was quite more passionate about the UI/UX field, I started learning new front-end technologies that were data driven and reactive, I spent the next three years in this field of work, developing and implementing seamless user experience and interface. I worked in Fandogh, a startup made by a bunch of our department's students with the goal of developing a series of online services to address a wide variety of educational and scholar needs. Working in this startup was one of the best and most refreshing work experiences, I have, because we could work on the projects we like, with the novel technology we prefer and if that's not the dream then what is? :)"

I've been working there for almost a year right now, a place with wonderful people and a functional working process.

(of course I don't mean mind-numbing casual mobile games that make you itch and spend every moment of your life :D). Math on the other hand, don't you really think it's amazing that we can model the world around us using a series of rules, measure it and then solve it using them? if you don't, then sorry my friend because you're quite dead inside :D nothing could ever bring me the satisfaction of solving a calculus or geometry problem after two weeks of thinking and struggling."
